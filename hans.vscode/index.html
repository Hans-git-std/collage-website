    Punjabi University is a collegiate state public university located in Patiala, Punjab, India. It was established on 30 April 1962 and is only the second university in the world to be named after a language, after Hebrew University of Israel. Originally it was conceived as a unitary multi-faculty teaching and research university, primarily meant for the development and enrichment of the Punjabi language and culture, but alive to the social and education requirements of the state.

    <h3><b>History</b></h3>
    Punjabi University was established on 30 April 1962 under the Punjab Act of1961 as a residential and teaching university, not as an affiliating university. It started functioning from temporary accommodation in Barandari Palace building. Initially its jurisdictional area was fixed as the 10-mile (16 km) radius. There were only nine colleges – six professional and three art and science colleges in Patiala — which fell within its jurisdiction. The university moved to its present campus in 1965. The campus is spread over about 316 acres (1.28 km2). The campus at Patiala makes international standard facilities available for students and researchers.[1]

Although initially, the main task before the university was to develop and promote the language of the Punjabi people, it has since evolved into a multi-faculty educational institution. It grew into an affiliating university in 1969, with 43 colleges affiliated to it and covering Patiala, Sangrur and Bathinda districts of Punjab. Since then, it developed significantly and acquired a distinctive character among the centres of education and research in the country. Now, it has more than 278 affiliated colleges[2] spread over nine districts of Punjab. The affiliated colleges are in districts of Patiala, Barnala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Sangrur, Bathinda, Malerkotla district, Mansa, Mohali, Rupnagar and Faridkot.
